DRAFT Process for Reviewing and Posting Official Meeting Minutes 
 
1. Draft minutes will be made available for review and comment by the Board.
  - Redline/comments will be made using the in-document change suggestion option.
  - Reviews are open for one week from the posting date, although significant changes/issues may extend the review period in rare cases.
  - Once the review window has ended, a note will be sent to the Board notifying that the review period has closed.

2. A note will be sent to the Chair asking for approval to release (it will be the Chairâ€™s responsibility to assess if consensus has been reached).

3. IETF Secretariat will post to the IETF LLC website.

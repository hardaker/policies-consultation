ELECTRONIC VOTING PROCEDURES

Decisions  of the Board, with the exception of Director removal,  may be taken by electronic vote as an alternative to a decision taken during a Board  meeting. A Vote Administrator (“VA”) shall be selected, and this VA can be either a Director of the Board or a member of the IETF Secretariat. The VA is responsible for posting a call for a vote to the Board mailing list (either IETF LLC Board-ONLY <LLC-Board-Only@ietf.org> or IETF LLC Board+ED+Secretariat <LLC-Board-ED-Secretariat@ietf.org>, as appropriate) in the form of a motion to be considered, along with a time limit of not less than seven calendar days, during which votes will be accepted. The vote shall end at the earlier of the expiration of the time limit or after all non-recused Directors  have cast a vote. Actual voting will take place via a web-based tool or via email as determined by the Board, and a vote is final once it has been submitted. Vote options are yes, no, or abstain. 

The VA is responsible for tracking the vote and announcing the result to the Board mailing list and to the Secretary after the vote ends. Unless a greater affirmative vote is expressly required for an action under applicable law, the ISOC-IETF LLC Agreement, or an applicable Board policy, the affirmative vote of two thirds of the Directors then in office shall be an act of the Board. Actions approved by electronic vote shall be noted in the minutes of the next meeting of the Board.

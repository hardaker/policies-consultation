**THE INITIAL POLICY DEVELOPMENT PROCESS IS COMPLETE - THANK YOU FOR YOUR FEEDBACK**



# policies-consultation
Materials for a consultation with the IETF community on IETF LLC policies.

The draft polices are in this project. You can comment on the policies *here* or via the LLC-Consultation mailing list (subscribe at https://www.ietf.org/mailman/listinfo/llc-consultation). If you wish to use GitHub, you can open Issues or create Pull Requests. Opening an issue is like opening a discussion item, and so you can raise a point and begin a discussion. Creating a pull request is proposing an editorial change to a part of a given document. Both will work for our process, but initially it may be best to open an issue for discussion.
